The Quantum Weirdness
Why reality defies our intuition

Quantum mechanics is one of the most fascinating and counterintuitive fields in physics. As someone exploring these ideas on my own, I've spent countless nights pondering how particles can exist in multiple states at once.

**Superposition** allows a particle to be in several places—or states—until observed. This isn't just theory; it's the foundation of modern computing with qubits.

*Entanglement* connects particles so that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter the distance. Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance," and it still feels that way.

In my personal journey, these concepts challenge my everyday perception of reality. They remind me that the universe is far stranger than we can imagine.
