AI in Science
How artificial intelligence is revolutionizing discovery

Artificial intelligence is no longer just a tool for chatbots; it's transforming how scientists explore the unknown. In my self-taught journey through science, I've seen AI accelerate research in ways that feel almost magical.

**Machine learning** models can analyze vast datasets, predicting protein structures or simulating climate patterns faster than any human could.

For example, AlphaFold has cracked the code of protein folding, a decades-old problem, enabling breakthroughs in biology and medicine.

But there's a personal side: as an independent learner, AI tools like Jupyter notebooks with Python have allowed me to experiment with data from telescopes or particle colliders without a lab.

*Ethics matter*, though. We must ensure AI in science remains transparent and accessible, not just for big institutions.
